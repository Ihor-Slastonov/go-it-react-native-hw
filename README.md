# Hi! My name is Ihor
**This is my first app by using Expo, React Native and Firebase**

In this app we are all friends, so you can share your mind and photos to all! There are alot of work to do in future? but right now enjoy alfa version 1.0 =)

For testing this app:
1) Download Expo Go from Google Play Store or App Store
2) You can paste this url `exp://exp.host/@jammik/my-app?release-channel=slastonov`
3) Scan this Qr code from Expo Go(if Android OS)
